# kOS-Computer
kOS Computer is a flight management system and a guidance computer designed to fully work with VR.
## Installation
Copy the files in the KSP directory respecting file paths, as usual.
The file "Patch.cfg" must be replaced: don't worry, it's a small thing (you can make a copy if you want).

About the craft files you can copy them in "../saves/[yoursave]/Ships/SPH" or in "../saves/[yoursave]/Ships/VAB".
## How to use the mod
You need a IVA with the Raster Prop Monitor (DE IVA is a good one). Until you understand how to do it you can simply load the ship "kos rover.craft". Check on the kOs processor that the boot file is set on "KOSmodore-BOOT.ks". When you are in game, pres "C" to go to IVA mode, then on a Raster Prop Monitor press three times the button "RESC.ST/TOT" on the top right. You will see the main page of the kos computer. You may need to restart your computer by double-pressing the "STDBY" key.
