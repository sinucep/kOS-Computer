# kOS-Computer file types
It is important to know that **kOS can not read text files** (even if it can create them). This is where the [ **.kst** ] type comes in. It's a JSON file with text lines serialized according to kOS rules.
There are various types of files that kOS can read and/or create:
* [ **.ks** ] - KerbolScript
* [ **.bas** ] - KSP-Basic
* [ **.pos** ] - Position
* [ **.trk** ] - Track
* [ **.dat** ] - Data log
* [ **.kst** ] - kOS serialized text
* [ **.json** ] - Logbook

## kOS serialized text
